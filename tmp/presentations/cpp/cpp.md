# Course Overview
- Introduction to C++
- Basic Syntax
- Data Types
- Variables
- Operators
- Control Structures
- Functions
- Arrays and Strings
- Pointers
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Modern C++ Features

<!-- 
In this course, we will start with the basics of C++ and gradually move towards more advanced topics. We will also cover some of the modern C++ features.
-->

---

# Introduction to C++
- History of C++
- Why use C++
- Setting up the environment
- First C++ Program

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout<<"Hello World";
   return 0;
}
```

<!-- 
We will start with a brief history of C++, why we use it, and how to set up the environment. We will also write our first C++ program.
-->

---

# Basic Syntax
- Structure of a C++ Program
- Tokens
- Data Types
- Variables
- Constants
- Operators
- Decision Making
- Loops

<!-- 
Next, we will cover the basic syntax of C++, including the structure of a C++ program, tokens, data types, variables, constants, operators, decision making, and loops.
-->

---

# Functions
- Defining a Function
- Calling a Function
- Function Prototypes
- Function Arguments
- Recursion

<!-- 
We will then move on to functions, where we will learn how to define, call, and prototype functions. We will also cover function arguments and recursion.
-->

---

# Arrays and Strings
- Defining Arrays
- Accessing Array Elements
- Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Strings
- String Functions

<!-- 
Next, we will cover arrays and strings. We will learn how to define and access array elements, work with multi-dimensional arrays, and use strings and string functions.
-->

---

# Pointers
- What are Pointers
- Using Pointers
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Pointers vs Arrays
- Pointers to Functions

<!-- 
We will then move on to pointers, where we will learn what pointers are, how to use them, pointer arithmetic, and the difference between pointers and arrays. We will also cover pointers to functions.
-->

---

# Classes and Objects
- Defining a Class
- Creating Objects
- Access Modifiers
- Constructors and Destructors
- Member Functions

<!-- 
Next, we will cover classes and objects. We will learn how to define a class, create objects, use access modifiers, and work with constructors, destructors, and member functions.
-->

---

# Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Base and Derived Classes
- Inheritance Types
- Multiple Inheritance
- Overriding
- Polymorphism

<!-- 
We will then move on to inheritance and polymorphism. We will learn about base and derived classes, types of inheritance, multiple inheritance, overriding, and polymorphism.
-->

---

# Modern C++ Features
- Auto Keyword
- Range-based For Loop
- Nullptr
- Smart Pointers
- Lambda Expressions

<!-- 
Finally, we will cover some of the modern C++ features, including the auto keyword, range-based for loop, nullptr, smart pointers, and lambda expressions.
-->

---

# Conclusion
- Course Recap
- Further Learning Resources
- Q&A

<!-- 
We will conclude the course with a recap, provide further learning resources, and have a Q&A session.
